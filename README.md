# Fermi Paradox
Fermi-Paradox is a 4X strategy game developed using Unity, inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_forest_hypothesis">Dark Forest Hypothesis</a> mentioned in the science fiction novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Forest">'The Dark Forest'</a> as a conjecture about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>. In the game, all civilizations must avoid detection by others and eliminate any that are discovered. Set in the Milky Way galaxy, players assume the role of a newly emerging cosmic civilization striving to become the last surviving Civilization.

The gameplay involves avoiding exposure to other civilizations, employing various strategies to protect the home planet or minimize losses if discovered. Players can also pursue alternative strategies, such as forming alliances with other civilizations to break through the Dark Forest and achieve victory. The game is currently under development
